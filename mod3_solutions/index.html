      <p>Mysore pak  is an Indian sweet prepared in ghee. It originated in the city of Mysuru, one of the major cities in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is made of generous amounts of ghee, sugar, gram flour, and often cardamom.The texture of this sweet is similar to a buttery and dense cookie.The origin of the dish is credited to his chief chef, Kakasura Madappa, who had not made any dessert. With time running out, the desperate Madappa began experimenting, wanting to present the King with something unusual. Adding gram flour, ghee and sugar, he made a soft pak (or mixture). This was presented on the royal thali as a hot, fudge-like sweet. <a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>
